From Destruction to Safeguarding: After World War II, awareness grew about the need to protect heritage.
World Heritage Sites: International campaigns safeguard iconic sites like Abu Simbel, where sunlight illuminates Pharaoh Ramses II’s statue twice a year.
Living and Intangible Heritage: Beyond monuments, we celebrate traditions, crafts, and oral histories.
Creative Economy: Culture sustains jobs and livelihoods.
3. Looking Ahead
Global Challenges: Climate change threatens cultural heritage. Pragmatic strategies are essential.
Digital Era: Safeguarding heritage now includes digitized artifacts and legal complexities.
